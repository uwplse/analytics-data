This repository hosts the raw data for the Coq Change Analytics study, as well as some processed data.

A more comprehensive README will be added here soon. In the meantime, raw log files of proof development data can be found in "raw," and a reconstructed Git history for interactive sessions can be found in "diffs-annotated-fixed-2." The scripts to process the data into Git commits are in "scripts"; the scripts for determining changes to tactics within proof sessions are not yet included.
